            <h3>"So Make the Frienship Bracelets"</h3>
            <p>A practice among fans along this tour has been exchanging handmade bracelets 
                representing different albums and lyrics, which has created a vibrant culture of connection and 
                community. This ritual stemmed from a lyric in Swift's song "You're On Your Own, Kid," and it
                enhances the concert experience, allowing Swifties to express their love for Taylor 
                while forging friendships and sharing unforgettable memories.</p>

            <h3>Fan Chants</h3>
            <p>During the show, fans participate in spirited chants that resonate throughout 
                the venues, creating an electric atmosphere. From iconic lyrics to catchy phrases, 
                these synchronized outbursts showcase the collective energy and passion of Swifties, 
                turning each concert into a communal celebration of Taylor's music and legacy. Some of the most 
                popular include "1, 2, 3, let's go b****" during "Delicate," and "you forgive, you forget, but you
                never let it go" in "Bad Blood."</p>

            <img src="13hand.jpeg" alt="13 Hands">
            <h3>Thirteen Hands</h3>
            <p>Writing "13" on the back of their hands has special significance for Swifties, symbolizing 
            their connection to Taylor. The trend was started by Taylor herself, and isn't just exclusive to the Eras Tour,
            as it has been a practice spanning over many years. The number 13 is her favorite and also represents themes 
            of luck, creativity, and community. Fans often use it as a way to show solidarity 
            and express their love for Taylor, creating a sense of unity during her concerts.</p>

            <img src="22hat-1.pdf" alt="22 Hat">
            <h3>The 22 Hat</h3>
            <p>At the start of the Red era, Taylor wears a black rimmed hat while singing "22." During the song, she 
                and her dancers make their way toward to front of the stage where a lucky fan is awaiting Taylor to give them
                the aforementioned hat and share a special moment together. Most often the fan is a child, but it does range in
                age and gender. Oftentimes the fan will "trade" for the hat by slipping a frienship bracelet onto Taylor's wrist.

            <h3>Surprise Song O'Clock</h3>
            <p>Surprise songs are a thrilling highlight of the Eras Tour, where Taylor 
                performs unexpected tracks that aren't part of the main setlist. These songs 
                often include fan favorites, deep cuts, or even rare gems, making each concert 
                unique. The element of surprise adds excitement and anticipation, which has made
                the surprise song section of the show a highly anticipated one of each stop. Fans 
                not at the shows even tune in to live streams during this time to find out what
                 Swift has up her sleeve for that particular night. Swift often invites a muscial 
                guest to perform with her. Among these guests include Ed Sheeran, Sabrina Carpenter,
                and Paramore's Haley Williams.</p>

            <img src="fearlesshearts-1.pdf" alt="Fearless Hearts">
            <h3>The Fearless Heart</h3>
            <p>The Fearless heart hands started many years ago on Swift's original Fearless tour. It happens during the song "Fearless,"
                where Taylor and fans share a moment showing their love to each other by throwing up a heart above their heads with their hands. 
                Many fans describe the moment like being in a stadium full of strangers turned friends.

            <h3>Light Up Wristbands</h3>
            <p>Fans are given specially-coded wristbands upon entering the stadium that create an interactive
                environment for fans during the show. These wristbands are programmed to respond to the show 
                in a purposeful way to add to each set, song, and moment. The wristbands of the crowd band together 
                to turn the stands into a canvas of moving color.
