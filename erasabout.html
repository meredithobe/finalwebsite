        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>The Set Up</h3>
            <p>The concert is broken up into 10 different eras spanning across 18 years of music. Instead of just
                the common "outfit change," the, set, outfits, props, and overall stage aesthetic changes completely to reflect
                the prospective album- or rather referred to as- era. The concert set up is completed by backup dancers and singers, a live band,
                and graphics on both the stage and backdrop. There are lots of lights, steam, and fire to complete the experience. 
                One era's lights are so strong that people cities away can see them.

        <h2>Some Notable Stage Sets</h2>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>The Lover House</h3>
            <p>The Lover House is a X-Ray view of a fictional house that was brought up during Swift's music video for the title track "Lover."
                The house features different colored rooms representing her seven different albums at the time of the Lover release. 
                In the background on tour, the house burns down, symbolizing the end of that era of love as she once knew it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>The folklore Cabin</h3>
            <p>The folklore Cabin is a mystical set piece in which she kicks off the folklore set while sitting atop the roof. It's covered with moss and decorated with
                delicate lighting, adding to the folklore experience.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-section">
            <h3>Champagne Problems Piano</h3>
            <p>The Champagne Problems Piano is, to put it simple, a piano that Swift sits down at and performs evermore's "Champagne Problems." Similar to the folklore Cabin, it is 
                decorated with moss and is the scene of the tour-iconic "champagne problems ovation," which has once lasted over 8 minutes.
